Python pair programming exercise

For this pair programming exercise we will follow few principles: 
1). Boy scouts rule: 
Boy scout rule says that leave the ground better than you found it. So our program is the ground. 
Leave it in a better condition than you originally found it. 
2). Avoid broken windows: 
As said in Broken window theory that a building tends to become more messy and chaotic over the 
period of time even if there is a single broken window. The same thing happens with code. Over 
the time code tends to become more chaotic, atleast for our little pair programming exercises 
we should not have any broken code on github. Simple rule: Only push code without any errros, 
any warnings on the github repository.
